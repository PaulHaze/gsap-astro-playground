# Astro Playground

```sh
pnpm create astro@latest --template PaulHaze/astro-playground {project-name}
```

A starter project I use for experiments and playing around. Come with DaisyUI and a sidebar installed. Simply create a new page and add it to routes.ts to populate the sidebar.

Inspired by the [Astrofy](https://github.com/manuelernestog/astrofy) free theme.
